# Finals

## Structure

- The finals is a _**2-Day event**_.

- A total of _4 rounds_ are to be played (2 rounds per day).

- The first team to win _3 rounds_, is _crowned_ the _**Champions**_.

- If after 4 rounds, there is a tie, teams have to go into [Sudden Death](#sudden-death).

## Sudden Death

- Only 1 round is played

- A [coin toss](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk03n1Vgo4i8_8FMhZgtXSM5KSszctw%3A1605612873323&ei=SbWzX4moE6TKmAWQ_4_AAg&q=coin+toss&oq=coin+toss&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIECCMQJzIFCAAQyQMyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADoECAAQRzoKCAAQyQMQFBCHAlDr9b4FWMP5vgVgtfq-BWgAcAJ4AIABVYgBxQKSAQE0mAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpesgBCMABAQ&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwjJ8NeHvontAhUkJaYKHZD_AygQ4dUDCA0&uact=5) is performed.

  - The winner decides if they want to _take the first turn or second_.

  - The loser decides the _language to play_ (_English_ or _Filipino_).

- _First team to have 5 cards left (instead of 0), **wins**_.

> ### Note
>
> - Instead of the usual play of trying to reach _0 cards left_, the target is _5 cards left_.
>
> - This effectively means that instead of playing 9/8 cards, teams are just playing with 4/3 cards.

## Attendance

- Please see the main [Attendance](./attendance.md) page for the general rules.

- Since the finals is split into 2 days, a team that forfeits a match/day loses both rounds.
