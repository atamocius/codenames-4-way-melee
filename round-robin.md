# Round Robin Matches

## Structure

- Each match is _3 rounds_ of [Codenames](https://codenames.game/).

- The team that wins _2 out of the 3 rounds_ wins the match.

- All 3 matches _must be played_. See [Points System](#points-system) section below.

## Points System

- Each round won by a team goes to their _point total_.

- The _top 2 teams with the **highest point total**_ will move to the finals. See [Moving To The Finals](#moving-to-the-finals) section below.

### Example

## Attendance

- Please see the main [Attendance](./attendance.md) page for the general rules.

- A team winning against a team that forfeited is _awarded the full 3 points_.

- If both teams forfeited, _both teams will get 0 points_.

## Moving To The Finals

- The _top 2 teams_ will go head-to-head in the _finals_.

  - If 2 or more teams are tied, the [tiebreaker rules](#tiebreakers) will be followed.

## Tiebreakers

### 2-Way Tie

- The _winner of the head-to-head_ matchup between the 2 teams will decide which advances to the [finals](./finals.md).

### More than 2 Teams Tied

If 3 or more teams are tied, a sequence of checks would have to be made, one after the other. If at any point in the list of checks a clear winner emerges, then that team qualifies for the finals.

If a winner has been determined but we still need 1 more team to advance, _the order of the checks will reset and start back at **Check #1** for the remaining unqualified teams_.

- **Check #1:** Compare the standings between the remaining unqualified teams. If there is still no clear winner, move on to the next check.

- **Check #2:** Compare the standings, but only considering their 3rd round performances of their head-to-head matches (ie. who won the 3rd round of a match will get a _"win"_).

- **Check #3:** Same as _Check #2_ but considering _only_ the 2nd round.

- **Check #4:** Same as _Check #2_ but considering _only_ the 1st round.

- **Check #5:** If at this point we still have a tie, it will have to be resolved _by chance_ using a _[roulette](https://wheelofnames.com/) (aka roleta)_.
