# Disconnections & Game Crashes

If for some reason a round in progress is disrupted by a power outage, disconnections, or game crashes.

- If the current score and the turn order is known, then a new game is launched but the amount of cards and the turn order from the _compromised game_ is reinstated on the new game.

- If the current score and the turn order cannot be restored/remembered, then the whole round is replayed.

  - If a lot of time has already been spent on the round, the round starts with just 5/4 cards left.
