# Spymaster's Guide

## Decorum

- The _designated Spymaster's mic must be muted_ throughout the duration of a round.

- No _Googling_ of any kind for any purpose.

- Please see the page on [Fairplay](./fairplay.md).

## Hints

- Must only be 1 word

- Refrain from reusing hints

- Must match the language being played for the round

  > ### Regarding Tagalog
  >
  > Tagalog words can be tricky as we use a lot of _Taglish_. However we need to draw the line and restrict Tagalog hints to _malay-based_ words (ie. lalake, babae, upuan, salumpuwit, etc.) and _widely accepted, borrowed Spanish_ words (ie. mesa, liberasyon, silya, etc.). Simply put, _English is not allowed_.

- Must not have similar spellings to any card on the board

  - ie. root words; added prefixes/suffixes _(panlapi: unlapi, gitlapi, hulapi)_
