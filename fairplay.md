# Fairplay

> ## _**Competitiveness**_ should always come with _**Sportsmanship**_ 😎🤝

## Honesty System

- _Honesty System_ is in effect.

- Obviously, everyone is at home without the peering eyes of other players and the Game Master.

- I highly implore everyone to be _shining beacons of fairplay_.

- The strict enforcement of the rules is highly dependent on the atmosphere of a match; _**toxic play and behavior will be met with the appropriate punishment**_.

## Violations

### 🟨 Yellow Cards

- A _yellow card_ is awarded for each _gross violation_ of the rules and guidelines during a match.

- These serve as warnings.

- After 2 yellow cards, a red card is awarded.

### 🟥 Red Cards

- _If a team already has 2 yellow cards_, and has committed a violation, a red card is awarded.

- Once a team has a red card, _succeeding cards awarded will now all be red_ during a match.

- A red card maybe given directly even if a team has less than 2 yellow cards _if the infraction is grave_ (ie. toxic behavior, cheating, etc.).

## Deductions

- For each _red card_ 🟥 a team has, the opposing team's _**cards per round** is reduced by 1 (one)_.

  - ie. if _Team A_ has _2 red cards_, then if _Team B_ has 5 cards left, then they only need to find 3 cards to win a round (5 - 2 = 3).

  - This applies to every round up until the match ends.

  - This also applies to the current round being played if red cards were awarded during a round.
